# jenkinsfile_example_python_in_docker
Jenkinsfile to run Python unittests in Docker from Jenkins.
The idea is to test the ability of Jenkins to start up Docker containers, run some tests and then close the container.
The advantage of this for continuous integration is that the build server setup is very simple; it just needs to run Docker.

The main use of this project is to test that my Jenkins+Docker setup is working as expected.
